### A collector's database

This database schema can be used for many kinds of collections. A typical garden has many collections.

Many reasons why we should start by organising data. Minimise iterations of development cycle.

Use cases determine fragments to be created. Start with minimal set.

#### Scoping

When specifying relations and attributes, we aim to have no more than what we need for use cases.

#### Normalisation

Avoid insert-update-delete anomalies. Do not have to update multiple tables with same data. Can denormalise later if required.

#### Conceptual data model (CDM)

Relations, their relationships and attributes can be seen at a glance. Entity relationship diagram.

#### Many-to-many relationships

Must be eliminated.

#### Referential integrity
